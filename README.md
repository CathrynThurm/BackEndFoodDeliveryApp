# BackEndFoodDeliveryApp

This is the backend of an application that orders and delivers food.
This was made using Javascript and Express.
The front end was designed by Thinkful and can be found at https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/starter-grub-dash-front-end
I was tasked with writing backend restful APIs from scratch that were unit tested to match the front end util.
